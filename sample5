Use Case Analysis
Current Behavior:
Payroll submissions are processed the same day.
ACH instructions are submitted to the ACH system around 4 PM for the current day's payroll.
ACH processes the instructions and completes the money movement by the end of the day.
Future Use Case:
Employers can schedule payroll for a future date (e.g., one or two weeks in advance).
The system should ensure:
Validation of payroll data at submission time.
Storage of the instructions with a scheduled execution date.
Timely submission of instructions to the ACH system on the specified processing date (around 4 PM).
The architecture must support job scheduling, idempotency, and error handling.
High-Level Solution
We can introduce a scheduled processing architecture to handle future-dated payroll submissions. The key components include:

Validation and Storage:
Validate and store payroll data along with the processing date during submission.
Scheduler/Worker:
Use a job scheduler (e.g., Quartz Scheduler, AWS EventBridge, or a custom CRON job) to execute future-dated ACH instructions.
ACH Submission:
On the scheduled processing date, retrieve the payroll instructions and submit them to the ACH system.
Resiliency:
Ensure fault tolerance by re-attempting failed ACH submissions.
Audit and Notifications:
Log every step and notify stakeholders in case of errors or successful execution.
Proposed Architecture
1. Components

Payroll Application (UI):
Allows employers to schedule payroll for future dates.
Sends the request to the backend with the processing date.
CIB:
Validates the payroll submission and forwards it to CCB.
CCB (Processing Layer):
Stores payroll instructions in a database with the processing date.
Triggers the scheduler for future-dated submissions.
ACH System:
Processes payroll instructions submitted on the processing date.
2. Data Flow

Payroll Submission:
Employer submits payroll with a future processing date.
The request flows through CIB to CCB.
CCB validates and stores the payroll in a database.
Scheduling:
A scheduler triggers a job on the processing date.
The job retrieves payroll instructions for the day and submits them to ACH.
ACH Processing:
ACH processes the instructions and moves money to employee accounts.
Detailed Steps
Step 1: Update Payroll Submission Flow

UI Changes:
Add an option for employers to select a processing date during payroll submission.
Backend Changes:
Update the API to accept a processing_date parameter.
Validate that the processing date is in the future and within a valid range (e.g., up to 30 days).
Store Instructions:
Store the payroll details along with the processing date in a database table, e.g., pyrl_scheduled_instructions:
CREATE TABLE pyrl_scheduled_instructions (
    instruction_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    employer_id UUID,
    payroll_data JSONB,
    processing_date DATE,
    status VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT 'PENDING',
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
Step 2: Implement Scheduler

Choose a Scheduler:
Use a tool like Quartz Scheduler (Java), AWS EventBridge, or Spring Batch.
Scheduling Logic:
At regular intervals (e.g., daily), fetch all PENDING instructions for the current date and schedule them for submission to ACH at 4 PM.
Job Execution:
At 4 PM, execute the scheduled jobs:
Retrieve the payroll data.
Submit the ACH instructions.
Mark the instruction as COMPLETED or FAILED based on the outcome.
Step 3: ACH Integration

Submit to ACH:
Use the existing ACH integration to submit payroll instructions.
Ensure the ACH system receives the correct processing date.
Handle Failures:
Implement retry logic for transient failures (e.g., network issues).
Notify stakeholders in case of persistent failures.
Step 4: Audit and Notifications

Logging:
Log every action (e.g., scheduling, execution, submission) for traceability.
Notifications:
Send notifications to employers if a scheduled payroll fails.
Technology Stack
Backend:
Spring Boot with Quartz Scheduler (for job scheduling).
PostgreSQL for storing payroll instructions.
Scheduler:
Quartz Scheduler or AWS EventBridge.
Messaging:
Kafka or RabbitMQ for event-driven communication (optional).
Monitoring:
Use tools like Splunk, CloudWatch, or Prometheus for monitoring and logging.

Let me know if you'd like further details or specific code examples!


Alternative Approach: Dynamic ACH Instruction Handling
Instead of batching payroll submissions for a specific processing date, the ACH system can be enhanced to handle future-dated instructions dynamically. This means you can send instructions immediately upon payroll submission, and ACH would internally manage the scheduling and processing on the desired date.

How It Works

Immediate Instruction Submission:
When payroll is submitted by the employer, CCB immediately sends the instruction to ACH with a processing_date.
ACH System Enhancements:
ACH stores the instruction with the processing_date and queues it for execution on the specified date.
ACH processes the instructions automatically on the scheduled date without requiring a new submission.
Real-Time Monitoring:
ACH provides real-time APIs to query the status of instructions (e.g., PENDING, PROCESSED, FAILED).
Feedback to CCB:
ACH sends asynchronous callbacks or notifications to CCB upon successful or failed execution of an instruction.
Steps to Implement

Modify ACH API to Accept Future-Dated Instructions:
Add a processing_date parameter to the ACH submission API.
Example:
{
    "instruction_id": "123456",
    "amount": 5000.00,
    "funding_account": "987654321",
    "recipient_account": "123456789",
    "processing_date": "2025-02-01"
}
ACH Internal Scheduling:
ACH stores the instruction with its metadata, including the processing date.
ACH schedules the instruction internally and processes it on the specified date.
Real-Time Status Tracking:
ACH provides APIs for CCB to query the status of an instruction:
Example endpoints:
GET /instructions/{instruction_id}/status
GET /instructions?processing_date=2025-02-01
Example response:
{
    "instruction_id": "123456",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "scheduled_for": "2025-02-01"
}
Asynchronous Notifications:
ACH sends callbacks to CCB upon instruction execution:
Success callback:
{
    "instruction_id": "123456",
    "status": "PROCESSED",
    "processed_at": "2025-02-01T16:00:00Z"
}
Failure callback:
{
    "instruction_id": "123456",
    "status": "FAILED",
    "error_code": "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS",
    "error_message": "Funding account has insufficient funds."
}
Benefits of Dynamic Instruction Handling
Real-Time Submission:
Instructions are submitted immediately upon payroll creation, reducing latency and dependency on external schedulers.
Reduced Complexity in CCB:
CCB no longer needs to manage future-dated scheduling or batching logic. The responsibility shifts to ACH.
Flexibility:
ACH can dynamically handle a mix of same-day and future-dated instructions without requiring separate processes.
Improved Monitoring:
Real-time APIs and asynchronous notifications enable better visibility into instruction statuses.

Modify the submission flow to send instructions immediately.
Testing and Validation:
Test the end-to-end flow with both same-day and future-dated payroll.
Conclusion
Dynamic ACH instruction handling simplifies the architecture by shifting the responsibility for scheduling and future-dated processing to ACH. This approach reduces complexity, improves flexibility, and enables better monitoring and resiliency.

1. Event-Driven Architecture with Delayed Messaging
Overview

Instead of using a batch job, leverage an event-driven architecture with a message broker that supports delayed messages (e.g., RabbitMQ with delayed exchange, AWS SQS with delay, or Kafka with scheduling support). The payroll instruction is submitted as a message to the broker with a delay corresponding to the processing date.

Flow

Payroll Submission:
Employer submits payroll with a future processing date.
CCB validates the request and sends a delayed message to the queue.
Delayed Message:
The message broker holds the message until the specified delay elapses (future processing date).
ACH Submission:
When the delay expires, the message is consumed, and the ACH system processes the payroll instruction.
Advantages

Simplified Scheduling: The message broker handles scheduling based on the delay.
Scalability: Supports large volumes of future-dated payroll instructions without additional infrastructure.
Resiliency: Built-in retry mechanisms in message brokers ensure reliable delivery.
Example Tools

RabbitMQ with Delayed Exchange:
Send the message with a delay header (e.g., x-delay).
AWS SQS with Delay:
Set the delay parameter when sending the message.
Kafka with a Scheduler:
Use Kafka topics with scheduled processing.

2. Database-Based Triggering
Overview

Store payroll instructions in a database table with a processing_date and use a real-time query-based listener to identify instructions ready for processing.

Flow

Payroll Submission:
Employer submits payroll with a future processing date.
Instructions are stored in a database table (e.g., pyrl_scheduled_instructions).
Real-Time Query Listener:
Use a listener or polling mechanism (e.g., PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY, Change Data Capture with Debezium) to monitor the database for instructions where processing_date = CURRENT_DATE.
ACH Submission:
When an instruction becomes ready, it is retrieved and submitted to the ACH system.
Advantages

No External Scheduling: Relies on the database for triggering instructions.
Simplicity: Easy to implement with existing database systems.
Transactional Integrity: Works well in transactional environments.
Implementation Options

PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY:
Use triggers to notify the application when an instruction becomes due.
Debezium:
Monitor changes to the processing_date column and act on updates.
3. Real-Time Processing with ACH API Enhancements
Overview

Work with ACH to enhance their API to support real-time instruction submission. Instead of submitting instructions in bulk, instructions are submitted one at a time as they become ready.

Flow

Payroll Submission:
Employer submits payroll with a future processing date.
Instructions are stored in the database.
Processing Logic:
Use a small service or cron job to periodically check for instructions due for processing (e.g., every minute).
ACH Submission:
Submit each instruction immediately as it becomes ready.
Advantages

Simplified Integration: Leverages existing ACH APIs.
Flexibility: ACH can process both same-day and future-dated instructions dynamically.
Reduced Complexity: Removes the need for batching.
Key Requirements

ACH must support accepting and scheduling individual future-dated instructions.
Callback or webhook mechanisms to confirm processing success.
4. Distributed Scheduling with External Tools
Overview

Use an external distributed scheduling service (e.g., AWS Step Functions, Temporal.io, or Apache Airflow) to schedule payroll submissions for future processing.

Flow

Payroll Submission:
Employer submits payroll with a future processing date.
CCB schedules a task with the distributed scheduler.
Task Execution:
On the processing date, the scheduler triggers the task to process the payroll instruction.
ACH Submission:
The task submits the instruction to the ACH system.
Advantages

Scalability: Distributed schedulers handle large volumes efficiently.
Reliability: Built-in fault tolerance and retry mechanisms.
Flexibility: Supports dynamic scheduling and chaining workflows.
Example Tools

AWS Step Functions:
Define a state machine for payroll submission and scheduling.
Temporal.io:
Use workflows to manage future-dated instructions.
Apache Airflow:
Schedule DAGs for processing instructions on specific dates.
Comparison of Approaches
Feature	Event-Driven (Delayed Messaging)	Database-Based Triggering	Real-Time ACH API	Distributed Scheduling
Complexity	Moderate	Low	Low	High
Scalability	High	Moderate	High	High
Reliability	High	Moderate	High	High
ACH Dependency	No	No	Yes	No
Scheduling Granularity	Milliseconds	Seconds to Minutes	Milliseconds	Milliseconds
Resiliency	Built-in retries	Requires custom handling	Built-in	Built-in
Recommended Approach
If ACH Can Be Enhanced:
Use Real-Time ACH API Enhancements for a seamless, low-latency solution.
Ideal for reducing complexity and leveraging ACH capabilities.
If ACH Can't Be Enhanced:
Event-Driven Architecture with Delayed Messaging is the best alternative.
It is scalable, reliable, and fits well into modern architectures.
If You Need Simplicity:
Use Database-Based Triggering for straightforward implementation.
This is effective if the volume of payroll instructions is manageable.
For Large Enterprises:
Use Distributed Scheduling if you need advanced workflows, dependencies, or complex scheduling logic.
Next Steps
Collaborate with ACH:
Discuss real-time instruction handling or future-dated scheduling support.
Evaluate Messaging Systems:
If ACH enhancements are not feasible, evaluate delayed messaging with RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, or Kafka.
Prototype:
Implement and test the selected approach with a subset of payroll instructions.
Monitoring and Logging:
Ensure detailed logs and monitoring are in place to track instruction lifecycles.
