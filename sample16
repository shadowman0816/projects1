Flow Design: Payroll Instructions Submission to ACH Processing

This document details the end-to-end flow of handling payroll instructions, including validation, submission, data movement, and potential complications. It also outlines key timings, thresholds, and risk considerations for each step.

1. Overview

When an employer schedules a payroll, the system follows these structured steps:
	•	Validation & Risk Checks
	•	Instruction Submission to Gusto via CIB
	•	Webhook from Gusto & Payroll Breakdown Retrieval
	•	Instruction Submission to Safeway
	•	Funds Movement & Ledger Updates by Safeway
	•	ACH Submission & Final Settlement

2. Detailed Flow of Data & Processing Steps

Step 1: Employer Schedules Payroll
	•	The payroll instructions are initiated by the employer in the UI layer.
	•	The UI submits the payroll request to the Product Service.

Processing in the Product Service
	•	The Product Service performs validations:
	•	Limit Check: Ensures that the payroll amount is within the employer’s pre-approved funding limits.
	•	Risk Screening: Flags high-risk transactions based on predefined risk parameters.
	•	Bank Account Validation: Ensures that the bank account details are valid and active.

Potential Complications:
	•	Payroll amount exceeding limits → Rejected/Flagged for Review.
	•	Risk Screening failure → Escalation to Compliance Team.
	•	Bank Account Validation failure → Request for Updated Account Details.

Step 2: Instruction Submission to Gusto
	•	If all validations pass, the Product Service submits the payroll instructions to Gusto via CIB.
	•	This includes:
	•	Employee pay details.
	•	Employer contribution.
	•	Tax breakdown.
	•	Deduction details.

Key Timing Considerations:
	•	Payroll must be submitted before cutoff times (e.g., 2 PM EST for same-day processing).
	•	Validation checks should be completed within milliseconds for real-time feedback.

Potential Complications:
	•	API failures in communication with Gusto → Retry mechanism required.
	•	Missing tax information → Payroll submission failure.

Step 3: Gusto Webhook Notification
	•	Once Gusto processes the payroll, it sends a webhook notification back to CIB.
	•	CIB forwards the webhook event to CCB, indicating that payroll is processed.

Action Taken:
	•	Upon receiving this event, CCB makes a GET API call to Gusto to fetch the detailed payroll breakdown.

Step 4: Instruction Submission to Safeway
	•	The system submits payroll instructions to Safeway, which handles tax remittance & payroll funding.
	•	Safeway processes the entire debit from the funding account and splits it into:
	1.	Employer tax payment (separate credit).
	2.	Employee payroll funds (separate credit).

Ledger Movements:
	•	One Full Debit from the Funding Account.
	•	Two or More Credits:
	•	Tax Portion → In-Process GL.
	•	Payroll Amount → Employees’ Accounts (via ACH processing).

Potential Complications:
	•	Tax amount discrepancies → Manual reconciliation required.
	•	Funding Account balance issues → Payroll failure notification sent to employer.

Step 5: Reference ID Submission from Safeway to Payroll
	•	Safeway generates a unique reference ID for the transaction.
	•	Payroll Service logs the reference ID and uses it to track ACH processing.

Timing Considerations:
	•	The reference ID must be received before the ACH submission window (e.g., 3 PM EST).

Potential Issues:
	•	Delayed response from Safeway → Payroll submission delays.
	•	Incorrect reference ID mapping → ACH reconciliation issues.

Step 6: ACH Submission for Final Processing
	•	The Payroll Service submits ACH instructions for the final money movement.
	•	ACH moves the funds from the In-Process GL to the Employees’ Bank Accounts.

ACH Instructions Include:
	•	Debiting Account: In-Process GL.
	•	Crediting Accounts: Employee Bank Accounts.
	•	Transaction Reference: Payroll Unique Reference ID.

Potential Complications:
	•	ACH batch submission delays → Employees receive payroll late.
	•	ACH return transactions due to incorrect account details.
	•	Processing failures → Requires automatic retries or manual intervention.

3. Data Flow with Timing & Thresholds

Step	Process	Time Required	Threshold Checks	Possible Failures
1	Employer schedules payroll	~Instant	Limit, Risk Screening, Bank Validation	Payroll exceeds limit, risk flag, invalid account
2	Submit to Gusto via CIB	<1 sec	API response	Gusto API failure, tax data missing
3	Webhook from Gusto	<1 sec	Response validation	Missing webhook, delayed response
4	Fetch payroll breakdown	<1 sec	Valid breakdown data	API failure, incorrect mapping
5	Submit to Safeway	<2 sec	Funding check, tax check	Tax miscalculation, funding issue
6	Safeway funds movement	~Minutes	GL debit, Credit verification	Safeway processing failure
7	Reference ID submission	<1 sec	Unique mapping	ID mismatch, delay
8	Submit to ACH	<3 sec	ACH format validation	ACH rejection, incorrect routing
9	ACH Final Processing	~Hours	ACH Success	ACH return, processing delay

4. Error Handling & Edge Cases

1. Payroll Validation Errors
	•	Limit exceeded → Notify employer, request additional funds.
	•	Risk check failure → Escalate for compliance review.
	•	Bank validation failure → Request new details.

2. Gusto Submission Failures
	•	Retries up to 3 times if API fails.
	•	Log failure event in event tracking system.
	•	Fallback: Employer manual resubmission option.

3. Safeway Processing Errors
	•	Missing funds → Employer notification.
	•	Tax misalignment → Manual reconciliation required.
	•	Delayed processing → ACH cutoff risks.

4. ACH Rejections
	•	Incorrect bank details → Reinitiate payroll with updated information.
	•	ACH return codes (e.g., R01 - Insufficient Funds) → Employer alert & retry.

5. Conclusion

This end-to-end payroll flow ensures a structured, automated process with built-in validation, risk mitigation, and proper error handling. The ACH submission timing and thresholds ensure smooth payroll disbursement while preventing major failures.

List of Options for Handling Payroll Webhook Events in Processor Service

When a webhook event is received indicating that a payroll is submitted or processed, the Processor Service determines the next course of action based on the payroll details. Below is a detailed breakdown of the options available, covering different payroll scenarios and system requirements.

1. Steps in Processor Service

Step 1: Webhook Event Reception
	•	Processor Service receives the webhook event stating payroll is submitted or processed.

Step 2: Retrieve Full Payroll Details
	•	Processor Service makes a call to Gusto via CIB Proxy to pull the entire payroll breakdown for the received payroll_id.

Step 3: Determine Processing Options
	•	Based on the retrieved payroll details, the Processor Service must decide the next action.
	•	The decision depends on timing, payroll type, and ACH rules.

2. Processing Options Based on Payroll Type & ACH Constraints

Option	Condition	Action	Complications
Option 1: Same-Day Payroll Processing	Payroll is scheduled for today	- Immediately push instructions to Safepay.  - Safepay moves tax money and does a debit. - Submit ACH instructions for same-day settlement.	ACH processing cutoff time must be met.
Option 2: Future-Dated Payroll Processing	Payroll is scheduled for a future date	- Push instructions to Safepay but DO NOT submit ACH instructions yet.- Safepay moves tax money & holds funds in in-process GL.- ACH submission triggers automatically on the payroll date.	Risk of misalignment if payroll date is modified.
Option 3: Payroll Exceeds Limits	Payroll amount exceeds employer’s approved funding limit	- Flag payroll for manual approval.- Notify compliance/risk team for additional screening.- If approved, push to Safepay.	Employer might need to add funds before processing.
Option 4: Payroll Risk Check Failure	Payroll flagged as high-risk transaction	- Escalate to risk team for review.- Notify employer with verification request.- If cleared, resume normal processing.	Fraud prevention measures needed before proceeding.
Option 5: Payroll Contains Invalid Account Details	One or more employee accounts are invalid	- Remove invalid accounts from batch.- Notify employer to correct account details.- Reprocess after correction.	May delay payroll processing for affected employees.
Option 6: Payroll Instructions Submission Failure	API failure when pushing instructions to Safepay	- Retry submission (up to 3 times).- If all retries fail, log error and notify support team.- Employer alerted for manual re-initiation.	If system-wide failure occurs, rollback required.

3. ACH Constraints & Their Impact

Scenario: Same-Day Payroll Processing
	•	ACH does not accept future-dated transactions.
	•	ACH instructions must be sent on the payroll processing date.
	•	If payroll is scheduled for today, Processor Service submits instructions immediately.

Scenario: Future-Dated Payroll Processing
	•	ACH instructions must be delayed until the actual payroll date.
	•	Safepay can accept instructions early, move tax money, but hold ACH submission.
	•	On payroll processing day, Safepay releases funds, and ACH instructions are sent.

4. Additional Edge Cases

Case 1: Webhook Event Duplication
	•	If the same payroll webhook event is received multiple times, deduplication logic should:
	•	Verify if instructions were already submitted.
	•	Ignore duplicate webhook events.
	•	Log an alert if repeated webhooks are received incorrectly.

Case 2: Employer Modifies Payroll After Submission
	•	If an employer updates payroll after it was initially submitted:
	•	Determine if ACH instructions were already sent.
	•	If ACH submission has not yet occurred, update payroll details in Safepay.
	•	If ACH is already initiated, notify employer that changes cannot be applied.

Case 3: Employer Funds Are Insufficient
	•	Payroll submitted but employer’s funding account has insufficient funds:
	•	Safepay detects insufficient balance before ACH submission.
	•	Notify employer to add funds before cutoff.
	•	Hold ACH processing until the funding issue is resolved.

5. Summary of Flow Decision-Making
	1.	Receive Webhook Event from Gusto (Payroll Submitted/Processed).
	2.	Pull Full Payroll Breakdown from Gusto via CIB.
	3.	Determine Payroll Type (Same-Day vs. Future-Dated).
	4.	Perform Limit & Risk Checks.
	5.	Route Payroll Instructions Based on Processing Options:
	•	Push immediately to Safepay & ACH for same-day payroll.
	•	Hold ACH submission for future-dated payroll.
	•	Flag high-risk transactions for manual review.
	•	Handle funding/account validation errors.
	6.	Trigger ACH Submission on processing day (for future-dated payrolls).

6. Conclusion

The Processor Service must determine the correct action based on payroll type, ACH constraints, and potential risks. A structured approach allows for real-time decision-making while ensuring compliance and minimizing payroll failures.

Options for Same-Day and Future-Dated Payroll Processing with ECS, SQS, and Kafka

Since we are using AWS ECS for deployment, SQS for message processing, and Kafka for ACH status updates, we need to define how same-day and future-dated payrolls will be handled efficiently. Below are different processing options considering these AWS technologies.

1. High-Level System Flow
	1.	Payroll is Submitted (Webhook from Gusto → Processor in ECS).
	2.	Processor Reads SQS Messages (Payroll instructions waiting for validation).
	3.	Processor Determines Processing Type (Same-Day or Future-Dated).
	4.	Processor Submits Payroll to ACH.
	5.	ACH Sends Status Updates back to Payroll via Kafka.
	6.	Payroll System Reconciles ACH Responses and updates employer & employee status.

2. AWS Implementation Options for Same-Day and Future-Dated Payrolls

Option	Processing Type	Workflow	Pros	Cons
Option 1: Real-Time Processing via ECS Tasks & SQS	Same-Day	- Processor reads SQS messages in ECS container.- If same-day, it submits ACH instructions immediately.- ACH updates flow back via Kafka.- Reconciliation handled via ECS task.	- Fastest ACH submission.- Scalable with ECS auto-scaling.- Ensures real-time updates from ACH.	- SQS processing can fail (DLQ required).- Limited control on ACH cutoffs.
Option 2: Scheduled Future Payroll via EventBridge + SQS	Future-Dated	- Processor holds future-dated payrolls in DynamoDB.- AWS EventBridge triggers an ECS task on the payroll date.- Task reads stored payrolls & submits to ACH.- ACH updates flow via Kafka.	- Ensures payroll is processed on exact date.- Automated scheduling via AWS.- No manual intervention required.	- Dependent on EventBridge timing.- Requires scheduled triggers for thousands of payrolls.
Option 3: Bulk Processing via AWS Batch & Step Functions	High-Volume (Same-Day or Future)	- Payrolls batched based on processing time.- AWS Step Functions coordinate ACH submissions.- ACH updates via Kafka trigger reconciliation batch jobs.	- Handles high payroll volume efficiently.- Reduces API calls to ACH.- Parallel processing optimized.	- Not real-time, only works well in bulk.- Payroll delays if batch fails.
Option 4: Streaming-Based Processing via Kafka & Kinesis	Continuous Payroll Processing	- Instead of SQS polling, processor reads Kafka events in real-time.- Kafka events trigger ACH submission dynamically.- ACH streams status updates via Kafka topics.- Lambda functions process failures & retries.	- Lowest latency payroll processing.- Real-time monitoring and fraud detection.- Works best for instant payroll needs.	- Complex setup (Kafka + Kinesis).- Higher infrastructure cost.

3. Handling Same-Day Payrolls with ECS & SQS

For same-day payrolls, we need real-time ACH submission before the ACH cutoff time.

Recommended Approach:
	•	Processor (ECS) reads SQS messages continuously.
	•	Validates payroll details (limit checks, risk checks).
	•	Immediately submits instructions to ACH via API.
	•	ACH sends status updates back via Kafka.
	•	Reconciliation runs in an ECS Task to match employer funding.

How Failures Are Managed:
	•	If ACH submission fails, retry with exponential backoff.
	•	If Kafka status update missing, an SQS DLQ holds the payroll for investigation.

Key AWS Services Used:

✅ ECS Auto-Scaling → Ensures real-time processing without delays.
✅ SQS DLQ → Stores failed messages for later retries.
✅ Kafka Streaming → Captures ACH status updates dynamically.

4. Handling Future-Dated Payrolls with AWS Scheduling

Future-dated payrolls must be held until the exact payroll processing date before being submitted to ACH.

Recommended Approach:
	•	Processor (ECS) reads payroll instructions from SQS.
	•	Stores future-dated payrolls in DynamoDB.
	•	AWS EventBridge schedules an ECS task to run on the payroll date.
	•	On the scheduled date, ECS task submits to ACH.
	•	ACH sends updates via Kafka.

How Failures Are Managed:
	•	If EventBridge fails, a backup Lambda function checks unprocessed payrolls.
	•	If ACH rejects submission, an SQS retry queue attempts later.

Key AWS Services Used:

✅ DynamoDB → Stores future-dated payroll records.
✅ EventBridge Scheduler → Triggers ECS tasks at the correct time.
✅ SQS Retry Queue → Retries failed ACH submissions.

5. Reconciliation Strategies with ACH & Kafka

Steps for Reconciliation
	1.	ACH submits transactions → Payroll updates internal ledger.
	2.	ACH updates are streamed via Kafka.
	3.	ECS reconciliation task validates:
	•	Whether all transactions are confirmed.
	•	Whether funds were deducted & credited correctly.
	4.	Reconcile payroll & employer funding:
	•	If mismatched → Trigger manual review.
	•	If payroll failed → Retry or notify employer.

Best AWS Tools for Reconciliation

✅ Kafka Consumer Groups → Reads ACH updates in real-time.
✅ AWS Glue + Athena → Runs payroll reconciliation queries.
✅ CloudWatch Alarms → Alerts on failed payroll settlements.

6. Summary of Options for Architects

Processing Type	Best Approach	AWS Services Used
Same-Day Payroll Processing	Real-time ECS processing + SQS	✅ ECS, SQS, Kafka, Step Functions
Future-Dated Payroll Processing	EventBridge scheduled ECS tasks	✅ DynamoDB, EventBridge, ECS, SQS, Kafka
High-Volume Bulk Payrolls	AWS Batch & Step Functions	✅ AWS Batch, Glue, Athena, SQS
Real-Time ACH Streaming	Kafka & Kinesis-based processing	✅ Kafka, Kinesis, Lambda, DynamoDB

7. Final Recommendations

🚀 Primary Approach for Most Use Cases: ECS + SQS + Kafka
	•	Handles both same-day & future payrolls.
	•	Scales well with auto-scaling ECS containers.
	•	Kafka enables real-time tracking & reconciliation.

📅 Future-Dated Payrolls: EventBridge Scheduled ECS Tasks
	•	Ensures accurate ACH submission timing.
	•	Prevents premature payroll execution.

⚡ High-Volume Payrolls: AWS Batch + Step Functions
	•	Optimized for thousands of payroll transactions.
	•	Reduces overhead for large employers.

8. Conclusion

Since ECS + SQS + Kafka are already in use, the best architectural approach is:
	1.	For Same-Day Payrolls → Process payroll in real-time and submit ACH instantly.
	2.	For Future-Dated Payrolls → Use EventBridge to trigger ACH submission on the payroll date.
	3.	For High-Volume Payrolls → Batch processing via AWS Batch & Step Functions.
	4.	For Reconciliation → Kafka + Glue + Athena ensure full payroll tracking.
